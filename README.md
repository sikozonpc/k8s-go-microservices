# Ride Sharing sample k8s microservice project

## Services

- api-gateway: API Gateway
- driver-service: Driver Service

## Intro
This is a golang microservices sample project using Kubernetes for both local development and for production, making you more confident on developing new microservices and deploying them.

## Requirements
To run this project locally all you need is [Tilt](https://tilt.dev/) and [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/)

Additionally, the `/web` folder is a NextJS web app, for that you need NodeJS (v20.12.0).

The project also offers a `skaffold.yaml` file which is obsolete, it's still in the project for demo purposes of Tilt vs Skaffold. Use it if you know what you're doing.

## Run

```bash
tilt up
```

## Monitor

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

or

```bash
minikube dashboard
```

## Deployment (Google Cloud example)
It's advisable to first run the steps manually and then build a proper CI/CD flow according to your infrastructure.

## 0. Enviroments
```bash
REGION: europe-west1 # change according to your location
PROJECT_ID: <your-gcp-project-id>
```

## 1. Build Docker Images
Build all docker images and tag them accordingly to push to Artifact Registry.
```bash
docker build -t {REGION}-docker.pkg.dev/{PROJECT_ID}/ride-sharing/api-gateway:latest --platform linux/amd64 -f infra/production/docker/api-gateway.Dockerfile .
docker push {REGION}-docker.pkg.dev/{PROJECT_ID}/ride-sharing/driver-service:latest -platform linux/amd64  .
```

## 2. Create a Artifact Registry repository
Go to Google Cloud > Artifact Registry and manually create a docker repository to host your project images. 

## 3. Push the Docker images to artifact registry

Docker push the images. 
If you get errors pushing:
1. Make sure to `gcloud login`, select the right project or even `gcloud init`.
2. Configure artifact on your docker config `gcloud auth configure-docker {REGION}-docker.pkg.dev` [Docs](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/docker/pushing-and-pulling#cred-helper)


## 4. Create a Google Kubernetes Cluster
You can either run a `gcloud` command to start a GKE cluster or manually create a cluster on the UI (recommended).

## 5. Update manifests files

Connect to your remote cluster and apply the kubernetes manifests.

```bash
gcloud container clusters get-credentials ride-sharing-cluster --region {REGION}--project {PROJECT_ID} && \
kubectl apply -f infra/production/k8s
```

If you need to redeploy you can use the same command above or just `kubectl apply -f infra/production/k8s`
Sometimes pods might need to be deleted for new ones to be deployed.

```bash
kubectl get pods
kubectl delete pod <pod-name>

# or for all deployments
kubectl rollout restart deployment
```

## 6. Enjoy!
```bash
Get the External IP from the api-gateway
kubectl get services
```

cURL for the /servies or establish a websocket connection to /ws/drivers!
```bash
curl http://{EXTERNAL_IP}:8081/services
```

Go back to locally developing your project by changing kubernetes context
```bash
kubectl config get-contexts

# For Docker Desktop
kubectl config use-context docker-desktop

# OR for Minikube
kubectl config use-context minikube
```

## Explanation

This is a basic example of how to structure a microservice architecture with Kubernetes.

You can try to run the `tilt up` command and then try to access the `api-gateway` service at `http://localhost:8081`.

You will see that the websocket request is being routed to one of the `driver-service` pods.

You can try to scale the `driver-service` to 3 replicas and then try to access the `driver-service` service again.

You will see that the request is being routed to one of the `driver-service` pods in round-robin fashion (check k8s config).

This is because the `driver-service` service is configured to use the round-robin algorithm to distribute traffic.

This is pretty neat and it's a good way to start with Kubernetes and explore the features it offers.
